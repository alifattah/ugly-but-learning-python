# Ugly but Learning Python

This repository is a playground for practicing Python basics. The main script, `app.py`, holds a variety of small code snippets. Most lines are commented out, so you can uncomment sections as you experiment.

## Running the script

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The active lines will execute and print their results.
